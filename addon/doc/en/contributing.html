<h1>Contributing</h1>
<h2>building the addon</h2>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>python 3.6 or above.</li>
<li>pip must be configured</li>
<li>scons (pip install scons)</li>
<li>markdown (pip install markdown)</li>
<li>msgfmt utility. The easiest way of getting it is by installing git bash and choosing to include bash tools at command prompt</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have everything installed, issuing scons at the root of the project should build the addon and generate docs.</p>
<h2>translations</h2>
<h3>translating the addon</h3>
<p>Assuming you have everything set up to build the addom (see previous topic) issuing scons pot should generate a pot file at the root project directory. It is them possible to generate and contribute the .po files for your language.
Current languages can be found at /addon/locale directory</p>
<h3>translating documentation</h3>
<p>Documentation translations are generated from .tpl.md (not from .md) files. This is why, except from this file (read.md) at the root of the project, you won't find other .md files.</p>
<p>The .tpl.md files are normal markdown files with one addition: if you use ${[var]} within its text, [var] will be replaced by a var with the same name defined in buildvars.py when the corresponding md and.html files are generated.</p>
<p>If no variable with that name exists, the substitution doesn't take place.</p>
<p>This is useful for example to generate links and titles with the addon version included without having to rewrite documentation.</p>
<p>To translate documentation, grab the readme.tpl.md file at the root of the project and translate it. The translated file must be named readme.tpl.md and must be placed inside the addon/doc/[lang] directory.</p>
<p>The ${[xxx]} vars need to stay untouched. To generate the docs, issue scons and the markdown and HTML will be generated.</p>
